# ItemFig
### A simple library for saving and readinc config for items in MC Forge.

## Current features:
- Reading and saving config values from and to a config file in json format.
- Auto-recreating config file from set default values if the config is deleted.
- Auto-recreating values for entire missing items in config file (i.e. when new item is added).
- Auto-recreating values for items' fields values (i.e. when you want to reset damage value of a weapon).
- Changing the location and name of the config file (extension can be only json tho).

## Current limitations (that I could think of):
- For now everything is put in one config file.

## Docs:
- Integration with IDE
- How to use
